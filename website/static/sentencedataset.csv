People think that a liar gains a victory over his victim.
"What I've learned is that a lie is an act of self-abdication, because one surrenders one's reality to the person to whom one lies, making that person one's master, condemning oneself from then on to faking the sort of reality that person's view requires to be faked."
And if one gains the immediate purpose of the lie - the price one pays is the destruction of what the gain was intended to serve.
The man who lies to the world is the world's slave from then on.

They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was noteangry.
"Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad."
But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen.
"The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana."
"Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting."
They picked up the gear from the boat.
"The old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the boy carried the wooden boat with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff and the harpoon with its shaft."
The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought alongside.
"No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat."
They walked up the road together to the old man’s shack and went in through its open door
The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the boy put the box and the other gear beside it
The mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack
"The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal"
"On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another of the Virgin of Cobre."
These were relics of his wife.
Once there had been a tinted photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.
"Okay, all right."
Unhand me.
Get over there!
You're finally awake.
Dreams don't come true when you're dead!

Do you think he got his butt done too? It looks fantastic.
You really think I don't have duplicates?
He had placed himself at her feet so long that the poor little woman had been accustomed to trample upon him.
"She didn't wish to marry him, but she wished to keep him."
"She wished to give him nothing, but that he should give her all."
It is a bargain not unfrequently levied in love.
"There is no such thing as Death, though there be a thing called Change."
"But then, something happened."
"Each time I'd go out, I'd see this one sea lion."
The next shark that came was a single shovelnose.
He came like a pig to the trough if a pig had a mouth so wide that you could put your head in it.
The old man let him hit the fish and then drove the knife on the oar don into his brain.
But the shark jerked backwards as he rolled and the knife blade snapped.
The shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut his jaws.
He hit him solidly and from as high up as he could raise the club.
This time he felt the bone at the base of the brain and he hit him again in the same place while the shark tore the meat loose sluggishly and slid down from the fish.
The old man watched for him to come again but neither shark showed
Then he saw one on the surface swimming in circles
He did not see the fin of the other
"I could not expect to kill them, he thought"
I could have in my time.
But I have hurt them both badly and neither one can feel very good.
If I could have used a bat with two hands I could have killed the first one surely.
"Even now, he thought."
He did not want to look at the fish.
He knew that half of him had been destroyed.
The sun had gone down while he had been in the fight with the sharks.
"“It will be dark soon,” he said."
“Then I should see the glow of Havana… If I am too far to the eastward I will see the lights of one of the new beaches.”
" I cannot be too far out now, he thought."
I hope no one has been too worried.
"There is only the boy to worry, of course."
But I am sure he would have confidence.
Many of the older fishermen will worry.
"Many others too, he thought."
I live in a good town.
He could not talk to the fish anymore because the fish had been ruined too badly.
Then something came into his head.
"“Half fish,” he said."
"How many did you ever kill, old fish? "
I am sorry that I went too far out.
I ruined us both.
"But we have killed many sharks, you and I, and ruined many others."
You do not have that spear on your head for nothing.
He liked to think of the fish and what he could do to a shark if he were swimming free.
"I should have chopped the bill off to fight them with, he thought."
But there was no hatchet and then there was no knife.
"But if I had, and could have lashed it to an oar butt, what a weapon."
Then we might have fought them together.
"What will you do now if they come in the night? What can you do? “Fight them,” he said."
"""I'll fight them until I die."""
But in the dark now and no glow showing and no lights and only the wind and the steady pull of the sail he felt that perhaps he was already dead.
He put his two hands together and felt the palms.
They were not dead and he could bring the pain of life by simply opening and closing them.
He leaned his back against the stern and knew he was not dead.
His shoulders told him.
"I have all those prayers I promised if I caught the fish, he thought."
But I am too tired to say them now.
I better get the sack and put it over my shoulders.
He lay in the stern and steered and watched for the glow to come in the sky.
"I have half of him, he thought."
Maybe I’ll have the luck to bring the forward half in.
I should have some luck.
"No, he said."
You violated your luck when you went too far outside.
"Follow him for a few days, maybe a week or two."
"But don't make the conversation too long, or seem like you're trying too hard."
"Charge 'em for the lice, extra for the mice, two percent for looking in the mirror twice."
"Here a little slice, there a little cut, three percent for sleeping with the window shut."
"When it comes to fixing prices, there are a lot of tricks he knows."
I never wanted that.
"Of course, it's one thing not to want something; it's another to be told you can't have it."
I guess it's just nice knowing that you could someday do it if you change your mind.
"But now, all of a sudden, that door is closed."

"In 1809 he took a tour in the north, appearing in Edinburgh, 25 January, as Sir Benjamin Dove in the Brothers. In 1809, in the same character, he made his first appearance at the Lyceum."
"Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her hand was in mine."
"A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two who had never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or even look of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble our hands instinctively sought for each other."
"I have marvelled at it since, but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should go out to her so, and, as she has often told me, there was in her also the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection."
"So we stood hand in hand, like two children, and there was peace in our hearts for all the dark things that surrounded us."
Feeling without judgment is a washy draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for human deglutition.
"Death is so terribly final, while life is full of possibilities."
"The owl, night's herald."
"Those who speak of love most promiscuously are the ones who've never felt it. They make some sort of feeble stew out of sympathy, compassion, contempt and general indifference, and they call it love."
Once you've felt what it means to love as you and I know it--the total passion for the total height--you're incapable of anything less.
"It's close to midnight, something evil's lurking in the dark."
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart.
"You try to scream, but terror takes the sound before you make it."
"You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes, you're paralyzed."
"Some feeling had started in my stomach and was traveling up to my face, and I knew that when it got there I would turn bright red and hear the ocean, which is what happens when I get put on the spot."
"Daddy's flown across the ocean, leaving just a memory."
A snapshot in the family album.
"Daddy, what else did you leave for me?"
"Daddy, what'd ya leave behind for me?"
"All in all, it was just a brick in the wall. All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall."
What's in your eyes 'cause they talk to me.
They know how to read my mind.
"I get this feeling when you're next to me, it's like joy and summertime."
I wanna be your favorite song that will only bring you joy.
"But now that I never see you, I can only wish for more."
"At the end of the day, I'll, I'll keep writing you."
Should I stop by and say hi or just keep riding straight?
"You have two choices: you can keep running and hiding and blaming the world for your problems, or you can stand up for yourself and decide to be somebody important."
"I see and understand Raphinha's anger, I was also angry."
I make the changes thinking abt the team and not to point fingers at anyone.
Fall back into place.
"You wide-eyed girls, you get it right."
Let's have a heart-to-heart.
"Well, a boy's best friend is his mother."
You're the best doctor ever.
"Hey, sir, I'm sorry for your loss. That is not a fun time, damn."
I just did what I thought you'd want.
"And, uh, I'd like to thank my amazing Mom. She's my hero."
"No matter how sick we are, we're always working. You never do any work."
"I just, uh, I don't want to hear about this narrative that she's the one with work ethic."
We don't have to do things the same way.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but that shit is funny."
"Don't say that again, I will literally fuck you up."
So now I have to decide. Decide whether to let the world be ground under your heel all because I played by my rules. I'm trying to decide. I'm going to kill you. But I need to decide how far I'm willing to go.
"I had the brief notion that his heart, pressed flat as a flower, crimson and thin as tissue paper, lay in this file. It was a very thin one."
"I've seen it all. I have seen the trees, I have seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze, I've seen a man killed by his best friend and lives that were over before they were spent. I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be. I've seen it all, there is no more to see."
It was about this time I conceived the bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection.
"I wished to live without committing any fault at any time; I would conquer all that either natural inclination, custom, or company might lead me into."
"As I knew, or thought I knew, what was right and wrong, I did not see why I might not always do the one and avoid the other."
But I soon found I had undertaken a task of more difficulty than I had imagined.
I want to make the sound of her head hitting the gate my new notification sound. The sound was so perfect that a special effects crew couldn't have done better.
Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.
"It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected."
"The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one’s deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field."
"The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger."
"Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons."
"Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death."
"The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness."
"By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure."
These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.
"While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules."
"According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one’s plans."
All warfare is based on deception.
"Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near."
"Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him."
"If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him."
"If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant."
"If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them."
"Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected."
"These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand."
Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought.
"The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all!"
"When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men’s weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength."
"Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain."
"Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue."
"Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays."
There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.
It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on
"The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice."
"Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs."
Taxes to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.
"On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people’s substance to be drained away."
"When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions."
"With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, wornout horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue."
"Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy’s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one’s own, and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one’s own store."
"Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards."
"Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours"
The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.
"This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one’s own strength."
"In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns."
"Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people’s fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril."
"Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy’s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good."
"So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them."
Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.
Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy’s plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy’s forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy’s army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.
"The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more."
"The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege."
Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy’s troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.
"With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem."
"It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy’s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two."
"If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him."
"Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force."
"Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak."
"There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:—  By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army. By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier’s minds. By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers."
"But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away."
"Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle."
"Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy."
"To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself."
"Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy."
Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.
Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.
"Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength."
"The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete."
To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.
"Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, “Well done!”"
To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.
"What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease."
Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.
"He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated."
"Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy."
"Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory."
"The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success."
"In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory."
Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.
"A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound’s weight placed in the scale against a single grain."
The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.
Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.
To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy’s attack and remain unshaken—this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect.
That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg—this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.
"In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory."
"Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more."
"There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard."
"There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen."
"There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted."
"This book is largely concerned with Hobbits, and from its pages a reader may discover much of their character and a little of their history."
"Further information will also be found in the selection from the Red Book of Westmarch that has already been published, under the title of The Hobbit."
"Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more numerous formerly than they are today; for they love peace and quiet and good tilled earth: a well-ordered and well-farmed countryside was their favourite haunt."
"They possessed from the first the art of disappearing swiftly and silently, when large folk whom they do not wish to meet come blundering by; and this art they have developed until to Men it may seem magical."
"‘Very well,’ said Bilbo, ‘it goes to Frodo with all the rest.’ He drew a deep breath."
"‘No, don’t give the ring to me,’ said Gandalf. ‘Put it on the mantelpiece.It will be safe enough there, till Frodo comes.Ishall wait for him.’"
"‘Everything,’ they answered."
"‘Good-bye, for the present, Bilbo. Take care of yourself! You are old enough, and perhaps wise enough.’"
"He paused, silent for a moment."
"Then without another word he turned away from the lights and voices in the field and tents, and followed by his three companions went round into his garden, and trotted down the long sloping path."
"It was five miles or more from Maggot’s lane to the Ferry. The hobbits wrapped themselves up, but their ears were strained for any sound above the creak of the wheels and the slow clop of the ponies’ hoofs."
"He kicked the tree with all his strength, heedless of his own feet."
"Quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves, and bits of bark; and made a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks."
These they heaped against the trunk on the far side of the tree from the prisoners.
At his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; but a change came over his dreams and he turned and groaned.
"They woke up, all four at once, in the morning light. Tom was moving about the room whistling like a starling."
I'm the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life.
It's awful.
"If I'm on my way to the store to buy a magazine, even, and somebody asks me where I'm going, I'm liable to say I'm going to the opera."
It doesn't matter and I'm feeling like a ghost and it's what I hate the most cause I'm giving up again and this time.
I might just disappear!
"The episode opens to a body of water, a small ferry cruising through the ocean."
The head of a large sea lion emerges from the water and the creature is shown to be pulling the boat.
"As the camera pans out, we see Azula, who is leaning her back against a railing with her arms crossed, and Ty Lee, who is looking out in front of them."
Doing nothing is a waste of time.
We're being sent away on a forced vacation. I feel like a child.
"Lighten up. So Dad wants to meet with his advisers alone, without anyone else around. Don't take it personally."
Doesn't your family have a house on Ember Island?
Cut to a wide shot from behind Lo and Li as the boat docks.
Cut to frontal view of Lo and Li.
"Welcome to Ember Island, kids."
The camera pans upward to the smallest of the beach houses overlooking the water.
"I saw it, and I thought it was pretty. Don't girls like stuff like this?"
"But, it's a painting of your family."
You think I care?
I think you do.
"You don't know me, so why don't you just mind your own business?"
I know you.
"No, you don't. You're stuck in your little ""Ty Lee world"" where everything's great all the time."
"""I'm so pretty. Look at me. I can walk on my hands. Whoo!"" Circus freak."
"Yes, I'm a circus freak. Go ahead and laugh all you want. You want to know why I joined the circus?"
Do you have any idea what my home life was like? Growing up with six sisters who look exactly like me? It was like I didn't even have my own name.
I joined the circus because I was scared of spending the rest of my life as part of a matched set. At least I'm different now.
"""Circus freak"" is a compliment."
"Guess that explains why you need ten boyfriends, too."
"I'm sorry, what?"
"Attention issues. You couldn't get enough attention when you were a kid, so you're trying to make up for it now."
"Well, what's your excuse, Mai? You were an only child for fifteen years, but even with all that attention, your aura is this dingy, pasty, grey..."
I don't believe in auras.
"Yeah, you don't believe in anything."
"Oh, well, I'm sorry I can't be as high-strung and crazy as the rest of you."
"I'm sorry, too. I wish you would be high-strung and crazy for once instead of keeping all your feeling bottled up inside."
She just called your aura dingy. Are you gonna take that?
"What do you want from me? You want a teary confession about how hard my childhood was? Well, it wasn't."
"I was a rich only child who got anything I wanted... as long as I behaved, and sat still, and didn't speak unless spoken to."
My mother said I had to keep out of trouble. We had my dad's political career to think about.
"Well, that's it, then. You have a controlling mother who had certain expectations, and if you strayed from them, you were shut down. That's why you're afraid to care about anything, and why you can't express yourself."
You want me to express myself? Leave me alone!
I like it when you express yourself.
Don't touch me! I'm still mad at you.
"My life hasn't been that easy either, Mai."
Whatever. That doesn't excuse the way you've been acting.
"Calm down, you guys. This much negative energy is bad for your skin. You'll totally break out."
Bad skin? Normal teenagers worry about bad skin. I don't have that luxury. My father decided to teach me a permanent lesson on my face!
"Because she doesn't just give you a present, she gives you a present and she tells you where to put it, how to use it, what it costs - for insurance purposes of course - and God forbid you should have a different opinion or you don't think it works in the space or you just get tired of waking up every morning with those horrifying animals staring at you!"
"Kadua romanzoffiensis is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae, native to parts of the southwestern Pacific (Niue, Samoa, Tokelau and Manihiki, Tuvalu) and much of the south-central Pacific (the Cook Islands, the Line Islands, the Pitcairn Islands, the Society Islands, the Tuamotus, and the Tubuai Islands)."
Chemical space is a concept in cheminformatics referring to the property space spanned by all possible molecules and chemical compounds adhering to a given set of construction principles and boundary conditions.
It contains millions of compounds which are readily accessible and available to researchers. It is a library used in the method of molecular docking.
There are no rigorous methods for determining the precise size of this space.
"Dropping all I got on this one day, I just wanna be somebody someday."
"I just want a friend that I can hang out with. Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with."
"I'm trying to look for motivation of smaller things, but baby steps to my atonement, when I foster dreams."
"So many things I wanna say that I'm not sure need to be known, but everybody swears they know me."
"I almost lost my father, still surreal for me to think about, considering how many of my friends have lost theirs."
They were the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided.
"The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts."
"The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war."
"The Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order."
"And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible for economic affairs."
"Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty."
The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one.
There were no windows in it at all.
"Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love, nor within half a kilometre of it."
"It was a place impossible to enter except on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbedwire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests."
"Even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons."
Winston turned round abruptly.
He had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen.
He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen.
"By leaving the Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow’s breakfast."
For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual position.
"Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the window."
"It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past."
"He could guess, however, that the book was much older than that. He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it."
"Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops (’dealing on the free market’, it was called), but the rule was not strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way."
He had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose.
"He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase. Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising possession."
The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary.
"This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp."
A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him.
"To begin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984."
"It must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two."
"For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary?"
For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper.
"Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down."
"On New Year’s Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the all-important business of ‘getting ready for the party’."
"Simple as the toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing and talking, and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the house."
"Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs."
"All day passed a a part of the next before any acknowledgement arrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crochety friend."
"We slept in what had once been the gymnasium. The floor was of varnished wood, with stripes and circles painted on it, for the games that were formerly played there; the hoops for the basketball nets were still in place, though the nets were gone."
"No guns though, even they could not be trusted with guns."
"The guards weren't allowed inside the building except when called, and we weren't allowed out, except for our walks, twice daily, two by two around the football field, which was enclosed now by a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire."
"A chair, a table, a lamp. Above, on the white ceiling, a relief ornament in the shape of a wreath, and in the center of it a blank space, plastered over, like the place in a face where the eye has been taken out."
She got it herself and tossed it at me.
"I'm borrowing five bucks off you, okay?"
That's it: she said we were going to feed the ducks.
"They must have poured gasoline, because the flames shot high, and then they began dumping the magazines, from boxes, not too many at a time."
"I explored this room, not hastily, then, like a hotel room, wasting it."
"I divided the room into sections, in my head; I allowed myself one section a day."
"I'm doing my best, she said."
"From below, from the driveway, comes the sound of the car being started."
Sometimes there are distant sirens.
"I glimpse him only for an instant, foreshortened, walking to the car."
"It's papered in small blue flowers, forget-me-nots, with curtains to match."
"There's a blue bath mat, a blue fake-fur cover on the toilet seat; all this bathroom lacks from the time before is a doll whose skirt conceals the extra roll of toilet paper."
"Except that the mirror over the sink has been taken out and replaced by an oblong of tin, and the door has no lock, and there are no razors, of course."
"The bath is a requirement, but it is also a luxury."
"I step into the water, lie down, let it hold me."
"One day, when she was eleven months old, just before she began to walk, a woman stole her out of a supermarket cart."
"It was a Saturday, which was when Luke and I did the week's shopping, because both of us had jobs."
"She was sitting in the little baby seats they had then, in supermarket carts, with holes for the legs."
"She was happy enough, and I'd turned my back, the cat food section I think it was; Luke was over at the side of the store, out of sight, at the meat counter."
"She fades, I can't keep her here with me, she's gone now."
"Maybe I do think of her as a ghost, the ghost of a dead girl, a little girl who died whenshe was five."
"I remember the pictures of us I once had, me holding her, standard poses, mother and baby, locked in a frame, for safety."
"Behind my closed eyes I can see myself as I am now, sitting beside an open drawer, or a trunk, in the cellar, where the baby clothes are folded away, a lock of hair, cut when she was two, in an envelope, white-blond."
"""I ain't got all day,"" says Cora's voice outside the door."
"I cannot avoid seeing, now, the small tattoo on my ankle."
"It's supposed to guarantee that Iwill never be able to fade, finally, into another landscape."
"The white headdress isn't necessary for the evening, because Iwon't be going out."
"""Thank you,"" I say, taking the tray from her, and she actually smiles at me, but she turns away without answering."
"There's a guy like me in every state and federal prison in America, I guess--I'm the guy who can get it for you."
"Tailor made cigarettes, a bag of reefer if you're partial to that, a bottle of brandy to celebrate your son or daughter's high school graduation, or anything else within reason, that is."
It wasn't always that way.
"I came to Shawshank when I was just twenty, and I am one of the few people in our happy little family willing to own up to what he did."
I committed murder.
I put a large insurance policy on my wife -- who was three years older than I was -- and then I fixed the brakes on the Chevrolet coupe her father had given us as a wedding present.
It worked out exactly as I had planned -- except I hadn't planned on her stopping to pick up the neighbor woman and the neighbor woman’s infant son on their way down Castle Hill and into town.
"The brakes let go and the car crashed through the bushes at the edge of the town common, gathering speed."
Bystanders said it must have been doing fifty or better when it hit the base of the Civil War statue and burst into flames.
"I also hadn't planned on getting caught, but caught I was."
I got a season's pass into this place.
"Maine has no death-penalty, but the District Attorney saw to it that I was tried for all three deaths and given three life sentences, to run one after the other."
"That fixed up any chance of parole I might have for a long, long time."
"The judge called what I had done ""a hideous, heinous crime,"" and it was; but it is also in the past now."
"Have I rehabilitated myself, you ask? I don't even know what that word means, at least as far as prisons and corrections go. "
"I think it's a politician's word. It may have some other meaning, and it may be that I will have a chance to find out, but that is the future - something cons teach themselves not to think about."
"I was young, good-looking, and from the poor side of town."
"I knocked up a pretty, sulky, headstrong girl who lived in one of the fine old houses on Carbine Street."
"Her father was agreeable to the marriage if I would take a job in the optical company he owned and ""work my way up."""
"I found out that what he really had in mind was keeping me in his house and under his thumb, like a disagreeable pet that has not quite been housebroken and which may bite."
Enough hate eventually piled up to cause me to do what I did.
"Given a second chance, I would not do it again, but I'm not sure that means I am rehabilitated."
"Anyway, it's not me I want to tell you about; I want to tell you about a guy named Andy Dufresne."
"But before I can tell you about Andy, I have to explain a few other things about myself. It won't take long."
"As I said, I've been the guy who can get it for you here at Shawshank for damn near forty years."
"And that doesn't just mean contraband items like extra 2 cigarettes or booze, although those items always top the list."
"But I've gotten thousands of other items for men doing time here, some of them perfectly legal yet hard to come by in a place where you've supposedly been brought to be punished."
"There was one fellow who was in for raping a little girl and exposing himself to dozens of others; I got him three pieces of pink Vermont marble and he did three lovely sculptures out of them - a baby, a boy of about twelve, and a bearded young man."
"He called them The Three Ages of Jesus, and those pieces of sculpture are now in the parlor of a man who used to be governor of this state."
Or here's a name you may remember if you grew up north of Massachusetts-Robert Alan Cote.
"In 1951 he tried to rob the First Mercantile Bank of Mechanic Falls, and the holdup turned into a bloodbath - six dead in the end, two of them members of the gang, three of them hostages, one of them a young state cop who put his head up at the wrong time and got a bullet in the eye."
Cote had a penny collection.
"Naturally they weren't going to let him have it in here, but with a little help from his mother and a middleman who used to drive a laundry truck, I was able to get it for him."
"I told him, Bobby, you must be crazy, wanting to have a coin collection in a stone hotel full of thieves."
"He looked at me and smiled and said, I know where to keep them."
They'll be safe enough.
Don't you worry.
And he was right.
"Bobby Cote died of a brain tumor in 1967, but that coin collection has never turned up."
I've gotten men chocolates on Valentine's Day; I got three of those green milkshakes they serve at McDonald's around St. Paddy's Day for a crazy Irishman named O'Malley; I even arranged for a midnight showing of Deep Throat and The Devil in Miss Jones for a party of twenty men who had pooled their resources to rent the films . . . although I ended up doing a week in solitary for that little escapade.
"I don't get all those things gratis, and for some items the price comes high."
But I don't do it just for the money; what good is money to me?
I'm never going to own a Cadillac car or fly off to Jamaica for two weeks in February.
I do it for the same reason that a good butcher will only sell you fresh meat: I got a reputation and I want to keep it.
The only two things I refuse to handle are guns and heavy drugs.
I won't help anyone kill himself or anyone else.
I have enough killing on my mind to last me a lifetime.
"He was a short, neat little man with sandy hair and small, clever hands."
He wore gold-rimmed spectacles.
"His fingernails were always clipped, and they were always clean."
"That's a funny thing to remember about a man, I suppose, but it seems to sum Andy up for me."
On the outside he had been a vice-president in the trust department of a large Portland bank.
"Good work for a man as young as he was, especially when you consider how conservative most banks are . . . and you have to multiply that conservatism by ten when you get up into New England, where folks don't like to trust a man with their money unless he's bald, limping, and constantly plucking at his pants to get his truss around straight."
"Oh, they read that scripture the way those holy rollers on TV read the Book of Revelation."
"They were the victims of judges with hearts of stone and balls to match, or incompetent lawyers, or police frame-ups, or bad luck."
"They read the scripture, but you can see a different scripture in their faces."
"Most cons are a low sort, no good to themselves or anyone else, and their worst luck was that their mothers carried them to term."
"In all my years at Shawshank, there have been less than ten men whom I believed when they told me they were innocent."
Leslie Harold Deaton was born in 1918 in a tough coal-mining village called Thurcroft in the South Yorkshire coalfield.
His grandparents Alice and Thomas had given up agricultural labor in the hope of doing better in the new mine.
"Their eldest son, my grandfather Harold, fought in World War I, returned to the “pit,” and eventually became a supervisor."
"For my father, it was diɽcult to become educated in Thurcroft between the wars because only a few children were allowed to go to high school."
"Leslie took odd jobs at the pit; like the other boys, his ambition was that, one day, he would get the chance to work at the face."
He never made it; he was drafted into the army in 1939 and sent to France as part of the ill-fated British Expeditionary Force.
"After that debacle, he was sent to Scotland to be trained to be a commando; there he met my mother and was “fortunate” enough to be invalided out of the army with tuberculosis and sent to a sanitarium."
"Fortunate because the commando raid on Norway was a failure, and he would almost certainly have died."
"He was demobilized in 1942 and married my mother, Lily Wood, the daughter of a carpenter in the town of Galashiels in the south of Scotland."
"If I had been on the jury that heard his case in Portland Superior Court over six stormy weeks in 1947-48, I would have voted to convict, too."
"It was one hell of a case, all right; one of those juicy ones with all the right elements."
"There was a beautiful girl with society connections (dead), a local sports figure (also dead), and a prominent young businessman in the dock."
"There was this, plus all the scandal the newspapers could hint at."
The prosecution had an open-and-shut case.
The trial only lasted as long as it did because the DA was planning to run for the U.S. House of Representatives and he wanted John Q. Public to get a good long look at his resume.
"It was a crackerjack legal circus, with spectators getting in line at four in the morning, despite the subzero temperatures, to assure themselves of a seat."
The DA with the political aspirations made a great deal of it in his opening statement and his closing summation.
"Andrew Dufresne, he said, was not a wronged husband seeking a hot-blooded revenge against his cheating wife; that, the DA said, could be understood, if not condoned."
He had fired the gun empty . . . and then stopped to reload so he could shoot each of them again!
"He purchased cigarettes, three quarts of beer, and some dishtowels."
"The detective from the Attorney General's office who had been in charge of the case testified that there was a turnout less than seventy yards from the bungalow, and that on the afternoon of September 11th, three pieces of evidence had been removed from that turnout: first item, two empty quart bottles of Narragansett Beer (with the defendant's fingerprints on them); second item, twelve cigarette ends (all Kools, the defendant's brand); third item, a plaster cast of a set of tire tracks (exactly matching the tread-and-wear pattern of the tires on the defendant's 1947 Plymouth)."
"In the living room of Quentin's bungalow, four dishtowels had been found lying on the sofa."
There were bullet-holes through them and powder-burns on them. The detective theorized (over the agonized objections of Andy's lawyer) that the murderer had wrapped the towels around the muzzle of the murder-weapon to muffle the sound of the gunshots.
He asked her how her trip to Portland had been.
"She replied that it had been fun, but she hadn't seen anything she liked well enough to buy."
"""That's when I knew for sure,"" Andy told the breathless spectators."
"He spoke in the same calm, remote voice in which he delivered almost all of his testimony."
What was right with him he'd only give you a little at a time.
What was wrong with him he kept bottled up inside.
"If he ever had a dark night of the soul, as some writer or other has called it, you would never know."
"But he told his story like a recording machine, seeming to say to the jury: This is it. Take it or leave it."
They left it.
"He said he was drunk that night, that he'd been more or less drunk since August 24th, and that he was a man who didn't handle his liquor very well."
Of course that by itself would have been hard for any jury to swallow.
They just couldn't see this coldly self-possessed young man in the neat double-breasted three-piece woolen suit ever getting falling-down drunk over his wife's sleazy little affair with some small-town golf pro.
Hard enough to draw blood.
He told the jury that on the night of the tenth he had been so drunk he could only remember what had happened in little isolated snatches.
"Later, much later, he speculated to me about the clerk who had testified on the 7 subject of those dishtowels, and I think it's worth jotting down what he said."
"If enough people want you to remember something, that can be a pretty powerful persuader."
"""But there's one even more powerful,"" Andy went on in that musing way of his."
"On the third night I asked him for some hand lotion, I didn't want to sound begging, but Iwanted what I could get."
"On the fourth evening he gave me the hand lotion, in an unlabeled plastic bottle."
"But that night, the first since the beginning of whatever this new arrangement was between us — I had no name for it — I felt shy of him."
I hadn't thought about the cat. Neither of us had.
I must have thought she was coming with us.
We could just leave her.
She'd hang around and mew at the door.
Me?
I was working 25 hours a week.
Get off the couch!
Do something with your life!
"Well, friends and neighbors, I was the one who went."
"He must have had just enough clearance at the shoulders to keep moving, and he probably had to shove himself through the places where the lengths of pipe were joined."
Then I see her.
"She's standing with two other women, over near the fountain."
"I have to look hard, again, to make sure it's her; I do this in pulses, quick flickers of the eyes, so no one will notice."
"She's dressed absurdly, in a black outfit of once-shiny satin that looks the worse for wear."
"It's strapless, wired from the inside, pushing up the breasts, but it doesn't quite fit Moira, it's too large, so that one breast is plumped out and the other one isn't."
"She's tugging absent-mindedly at the top, pulling it up."
"There's a wad of cotton attached to the back, I can see it as she half turns; it looks like a sanitary pad that's been popped like a piece of popcorn."
"Attached to her head are two ears, of a rabbit or deer, it's not easy to tell; one of the ears has lost its starch or wiring and is flopping halfway down."
She has a black bow tie around her neck and is wearing black net stockings and black high heels. She always hated high heels.
"The whole costume, antique and bizarre, reminds me of something from the past, but I can't think what."
"A stage play, a musical comedy?"
"Girls dressed for Easter, in rabbit suits."
"What is the significance of it here, why are rabbits supposed to be sexually attractive to men?"
Moira is smoking a cigarette.
"She takes a drag, passes it to the woman on her left, who's in red spangles with a long pointed tail attached, and silver horns; a devil outfit."
"Now she has her arms folded across her front, under her wired-up breasts."
"She stands on one foot, then the other, her feet must hurt; her spine sags slightly."
She gazes without interest or speculation around the room.
This must be familiar scenery.
"Iwill her to look at me, to see me, but her eyes slide over me as if I'm just another palm tree, another chair."
"Surely she must turn, I'm willing so hard, she must look at me, before one of the men comes over to her, before she disappears."
"Already the other women with her, the blonde in the short pink bed jacket with the tatty fur trim, has been appropriated, has entered the glass elevator, has ascended out of sight."
"Moira swivels her head around again, checking perhaps for prospects."
"It must be hard to stand there unclaimed, as if she's at a high school dance, being looked over."
This time her eyes snag on me.
She sees me.
She knows enough not to react.
"We stare at one another, keeping our faces blank, apathetic."
"Then she makes a small motion of her head, a slight jerk to the right."
"She takes the cigarette back from the woman in red, holds it to her mouth, lets her hand rest in the air a moment, all five fingers outspread."
Then she turns her back on me.
"I have five minutes to get to the women's wash room, which must be somewhere to her right."
I look around: no sign of it.
"Nor can Irisk getting up and walking anywhere, without the Commander."
"""Enjoying yourself?"" he says."
"""Of course,"" he says."
"""Is there a washroom?"" I say."
"""It's over there."" He nods."
"""What if someone stops me?"""
"""Just show them your tag,"" he says."
"""It'll be all right. They'll know you're taken."""
I find the entrance to the women's washroom.
"It still says Ladies, in scrolly gold script."
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
At last.
"If you like tuna and tomato sauce, try combining the two, it’s really not as bad as it sounds."
Flying fish flew by the space station.

I cried so much watching this scene.
Bravery and honour.
"Hey man, nice dress!"
I'm gonna go ride it now.
Good for you.
"Nope, have fun."
I'm glad you're glad.
"Fine, keep walking if you really feel like it."
You're not going to master it in a day; even I'm not that good.
It's not about strength.
Our technique is about using our opponent's force against them.
I fell on purpose to make you feel better!
"Okay, it was a lucky shot."
Let's see if you can do it again.
I'm sure it'll be here any second.
"Not that again, boring!"
Where are you going?
Don't leave!
Maybe next time.
I wanted to make sure you're safe.
Back then you acted like you didn't care.

"I live in North Wales, UK."
"For anyone who has had the pleasure of visiting, it truly is a beautiful place to live, though, for an adolescent boy, it is certainly lacking in things to do."
"As a result, my friends and I would often find ourselves mindlessly exploring areas of countryside and coastline."
"Despite it being quite sparsely populated, in comparison to the closest cities, there is a dual carriageway running right along the coast from Wales into England."
"Also, train tracks run alongside this road for most of its course, occasionally passing overhead via a small cement bridge."
"Anyway, there was one night a few years ago, when about four of us randomly decided to try and explore the inside of one of these bridges, as one of the group had observed a man-hole cover nearby which we believed to be the entrance."
"On closer inspection, we discovered that several tools would be required in order to gain entry."
"This had to be done stealthily as the train track was right beside us, not close enough to be of any danger, but definitely a sufficiently small distance to cause panic for any train driver."
And panic usually means Police.
"It wasn't long before we had removed the heavy steel disc, and had started descending the ladder down into the structure."
"Once we had all safely reached the bottom, we decided to progress to the other side."
" At this point, we are totally confined into the narrow space that leads into the main area."
"If you are confused as to what the hell this 'bridge' is supposed to be, you probably should be, because it was rather peculiar."
"I mean, I would have never known there was even an inside had we not found the man-hole."
"So, as we squeeze and crouch, and at one point scrape along our bellies, to the other side of the structure there is a growing sense of claustrophobia between us."
"The distance from end to the other is surprisingly long, but by the halfway point you can look down through narrow gaps onto the motorway below."
"This was actually pretty cool, which helped keep us calm, in a strange way."
"At this point, apart from the mild discomfort and confinement, we were still just a group of guys on an adventure."
This was about to change dramatically.
"Slightly hesitantly, we agreed to investigate."
Bad move.
"I reached the end first, and let me tell you, I have never felt the same sense of dread before or since."
In front of me was a single fold-away chair positioned facing a wall.
"On the wall was a partially torn page from a newspaper, or a magazine, showing a fully naked lady in an erotic position."
More disturbingly the eyes of the woman on display had been cut from the page.
"Removed with precision, not just hastily ripped off."
"The scene that lay before us had rendered us completely speechless, and an overpowering sense of panic could be felt collectively."
That was when we found the condom.
"The horrendous, gut-wrenching, blood-drenched condom."
"Needless to say we got the fuck out of there as fast as humanly possible, smashing our knees and shins against the sharp cement edges, that lined the path to the ladder by which we had entered."
"Of course, we were all praying to God that the man-hole hadn't been re-sealed, as it was impossible to tell until you reached the ladder itself."
"Thankfully the exit route was clear, and we promptly dashed as far away as our legs could carry us."
It has just come to my realisation that what we unearthed that night has not once been uttered to another soul. 
"So, there you have it."
"If anything, it was even worse than I had imagined."
We were not disappointed.
"The amount of dust in the passageways is actually quite unbearable, but that is nothing compared to the constant stench that must be endured."
"Also, the heat didn't help the situation either."
"I won't ramble on, but I must express how vulnerable you feel when navigating through the tunnels."
"Even with two of us, both carrying appropriate weaponry, the sense of 'evil' was overpowering."
"The tension is amplified tenfold by the fact that, had we encountered someone or something, the layout of the structure, and the multiple tight-squeezes, mean a safe, speedy exit is nigh on impossible."
It truly is a hell-hole.
This happened to me four years ago.
It’s by far the most extreme and life threatening situation I’ve been in.
"The eyewitness account you are about to read is 100% true, and is mine."
"For some understanding, this happened in the United States. It was the summer of 2012."
My longtime boyfriend and I had recently gotten married.
"Even though we were dirt poor college students and lived in a dinky apartment, we were having a blast."
That particular summer we gathered with our friends at the local movie theater almost every weekend.
There was one just down the street from our apartment that had really cheap movie tickets.
A night out that was under $10 was certainly within our budget!
I had just finished working a 12 hour shift and was pretty tired. I almost refused the invitation and thought of crashing in my apartment instead.
"However, I didn’t want to miss out on the fun, and it was a movie I'd wanted to see for a while anyway."
"Certainly it wouldn’t do any harm to stay up later than usual and miss a few hours of sleep, right?"
t 10:30 PM we met at the theater.
"he ticket booth was to the right of the entrance, and just above that was an electronic list of movies being played."
"Being paranoid that the tickets would sell out quickly, one of my friends swung by earlier that day and purchased tickets for all of us."
We bypassed the ticket line and went straight to the ticket taker.
"She smiled at us and kindly directed us to Theater 9, which was on the right side of the lobby."
If only I had known what I do now.
That among the crowds a killer was lurking.
"I think about it often now, what I would have done had I known."
"Pulled the fire alarm, called the police, screamed for people to run away."
"But, of course, I had no way of knowing what was about to happen."
"ne of my friends then spotted a row with five empty seats all next to each other, perfect for the amount of people we had."
These seats were about 3-4 rows up from where the seating rows start to elevate.
We ran up the stairs before someone could take the seats and filed in.
"I sat next to him, and my friend Samantha sat next to me on my right side."
"We spent the next several minutes casually chatting, joking around, and laughing."
 After a while my three friends went to the lobby to buy drinks and that addicting movie theater popcorn.
"he theater was bright since the lights weren’t dimmed yet, and I could see everyone clearly."
One person even had a mask and one of those shirts with an attached cape.
"There were a lot of kids in attendance as well, which wasn’t surprising because, even though it was a Thursday night, it was summer vacation so that meant no school the next day."
"Of all the people I saw, the person I will never forget was the little girl sitting in our same row a few chairs away. "
"She was really cute, blond with blue eyes, and passed us several times on her way to the lobby, each time coming back with various snacks and popcorn."
"Overall, people seemed very excited to see the movie, and the room was filled with energy and laughter."
"After what seemed like an eternity of waiting, the lights started to dim and the previews began."
The animation had this ugly CGI cat in a tuxedo that was sitting in a movie theater.
It was well past our bedtime when our mom woke up off the couch to put us to bed.
